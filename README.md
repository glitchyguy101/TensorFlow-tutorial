<p id="description">TensorFlow Practice: Fashion MNIST &amp; IMDB Reviews This repository contains my practice implementations of deep learning models using TensorFlow and Keras. The project focuses on two fundamental tasks in machine learning: computer vision (image classification) and natural language processing (sentiment analysis). 📂 Project Overview 1. Fashion MNIST Classification Goal: Classify grayscale images of clothing items into 10 categories (e.g. T-shirt Trouser Sneaker). Dataset: Fashion MNIST 60000 training images 10000 test images. 28x28 grayscale pixel resolution. Model Approach: Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) / Dense Neural Network. 2. IMDB Movie Review Sentiment Analysis Goal: Classify movie reviews as either "Positive" or "Negative". Dataset: IMDB Large Movie Review Dataset 50000 reviews (25k train 25k test). Model Approach: Text Vectorization with Embedding layers and Global Average Pooling. 🛠️ Tech Stack &amp; Dependencies Python 3.x TensorFlow / Keras (2.x) NumPy (Data manipulation) Matplotlib (Visualization of training history and predictions) Pandas (Data handling)</p>
