TensorFlow Practice: Fashion MNIST & IMDB Reviews

This repository contains my practice implementations of deep learning models using TensorFlow and Keras. The project focuses on two fundamental tasks in machine learning: computer vision (image classification) and natural language processing (sentiment analysis).

📂 Project Overview

Fashion MNIST Classification
Goal: Classify grayscale images of clothing items into 10 categories (e.g., T-shirt, Trouser, Sneaker).

Dataset: Fashion MNIST

60,000 training images, 10,000 test images.

28x28 grayscale pixel resolution.

Model Approach: Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) / Dense Neural Network.

IMDB Movie Review Sentiment Analysis
Goal: Classify movie reviews as either "Positive" or "Negative".

Dataset: IMDB Large Movie Review Dataset

50,000 reviews (25k train, 25k test).

Model Approach: Text Vectorization with Embedding layers and Global Average Pooling.
